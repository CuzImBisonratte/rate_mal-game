# Rate Mal! - The Game

Rate Mal! is a game i got to know in school.  
Because we could only play it in small groups, because otherwise the evaluation of the points would take too much time.  
So i thought: "If i could make it a digital game out of it, there would be no such restriction!"

## Gameplay
There is a situation told and the students need to decide what they themselfes would do (They can only choose between three answers).  
Also they need to guess how many students would choose each answer.  
Then the points are evaluated as followed:
1. All answers are collected and summed up per answer.
2. Results are assigned to the students as following:
    - If the guess is the same as students who chose the answer, the student gets 5 points
    - If the guess is 1+- the student gets 3 points
3. Next round starts
